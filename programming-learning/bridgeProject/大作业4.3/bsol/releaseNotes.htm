<strong><h2>Bridge Solver Release Notes</h2></strong>
<p><strong>1st September 2025</strong></p>
<li>The invocation of BSOL now supports an optional xml parameter which provides the url of a USEBIO format XML file for an event. In conjunction with the file parameter this provides the same Results Analysis functionality which is available to Bridgewebs hosted clubs</li><BR>
<p><strong>August 2025</strong></p>
<li>No new functionality, but distribution now includes the source files for the WebAssembly module and brief developer notes</li><BR>
<p><strong>April 2025</strong></p>
<li>High Card Points display now has option to display points calculated using Kaplan-Reubens evaluation</li><BR>
<p><strong>February 2025</strong></p>
<li>New dropdown box on Options dialog allows choice of characters used for honour card display (JQKA,BDKA,VDRA,or BVHA). Default is JQKA</li><BR>
<p><strong>June 2023</strong></p>
<li> The &quot;<strong>More..</strong>&quot; button at the bottom of the Bridge Solver display shows a menu allowing the new functions to be accessed.</li>
<br>
<li> &quot;<strong>More../Analyse All Boards</strong>&quot; calculates makeable contracts and optimum contracts/scores for all boards in the loaded board set. This operation is performed in the background with all double dummy calculations performed in the user's browser. The speed of this calculation depends on the performance of the user's device. A green progress bar at the top of the display is shown while the calculation is in progress. Boards can still be &quot;played&quot; interactively while the background operation is in progress.</li>
<br>
<li> &quot;<strong>More../Show Player Accuracy Matrix</strong>&quot; shows the number of deviations from optimal double dummy play for each board, for each player. This calculation can only be performed if the loaded boards contain card play sequences, which will normally only be the case if the event was played online. The display also ranks the players according to the average number of deviations for the player across all boards. As with &quot;Analyse All Boards&quot; this calculation is performed in the background and progress is indicated by the green progress bar. Boards can still be &quot;played&quot; interactively while the background operation is in progress. The results of the player accuracy calculations are cached for a period, so repeating the function will display the results more or less immediately. More information on the player accuracy function is available via the Help button on the Player Accuracy matrix display.</li>
<br>
<li> &quot;<strong>Auto-Analyse Entire Board Set</strong>&quot; (under &quot;More../Settings&quot;) controls whether an Analyse All operation is automatically launched in the background when a board set is loaded into Bridge Solver Online. This is not performed if the event results are hosted on BridgeWebs because these events normally already include makeable contracts/optimal contracts. If not, then the &quot;More../Analyse All Boards&quot; function can be intitiated manually.</li>
